A basic contact form that is light and easy to use.



== Description ==

[Documentation](https://github.com/demetris/omni-contact-form/blob/master/README.md) (at GitHub)
[Changelog](https://github.com/demetris/omni-contact-form/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) (at GitHub)

= Usage =

Add `[omni-contact-form]` to a post or page to display the form. This shortcode generates the default form: two fields (email address and message) and a button to send the message.

You can customize the form by using a number of shortcde attributes. See the [documentation](https://github.com/demetris/omni-contact-form/blob/master/README.md) at GitHub.

= Features =

*   Configuration via shortcode attributes (there is no settings page)
*   Required fields only: if a field is in the form, it must be filled
*   Submission via Ajax (no page reloads)
*   Clean and simple error messages
*   Discreet operation: only adds CSS and JavaScript to its own page
*   Basic anti-spam protection by default
*   Optional multiplication quiz for additional anti-spam protection
*   Printable copy of the message displayed after submission
*   Translation-ready

= Requirements =

**Server-side**

*   PHP 7.0 or newer
*   WordPress 4.9.9 or newer
*   WordPress REST API (comes with WordPress since version 4.7)

**Client-side**
