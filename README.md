Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Manual

Get the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/demetris/omni-contact-form/releases) and install it with your preferred method.

### Automatic

Use the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin.



Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert the shortcode `[omni-contact-form]` into a page or post to display the form. This generates the default form: two fields (email address and message) and a submit button.

To customize the formâ€™s appearance and behaviour, you can use a number of shortcode attributes (see tables below).

Here are two examples:

`[omni-contact-form name="yes" quiz="yes" cc="10"]`

`[omni-contact-form quiz="yes" message-label="Your complaint"]`

The first example generates a form that, in addition to the defaults, has a name field and a quiz field, and also sends a carbon copy to the WordPress user with ID 10.

The second example generates a form with a multiplication quiz and with the message label *Your complaint* (instead of the default *Message*).



Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic attributes you can use to customize the behaviour of the form are:

| Attribute    | Value         | Default     | Description                                                             |
|:-------------|:--------------|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`       | yes/no        | no          | Include a name field in the form                                        |
| `subject`    | yes/no        | no          | Include a subject field in the form                                     |
| `quiz`       | yes/no        | no          | Include a multiplication quiz as a basic antispam measure               |
| `css`        | yes/no        | yes         | Include basic styling                                                   |
| `cc`         | number        | not set     | ID or IDs (comma-separated) of users to send carbon copies to           |
| `to`         | number        | not set     | ID of user to send the messages to (overrides WordPress default)        |
| `redirect`   | number        | not set     | ID of page or post to redirect to after successful submission           |


### Notes

If a `cc` ID is invalid, no carbon copy will be sent for it.

If the `to` ID is invalid, the messages go to the default address, which is the email address for admin puproses in the General Settings of WordPress.

If the `redirect` ID is invalid, there will be no redirection after successful submission.

The plugin will add notices at the top of the messages it sents if there are invalid `cc`, `to` or `redirect` values.



Custom form labels
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are also shortcode attributes to change the default labels:

| Attribute                    | Default                                                           |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `email-label`                | Email address                                                     |
| `message-label`              | Message                                                           |
| `name-label`                 | Name                                                              |
| `progress-text`              | Sending...                                                        |
| `submit-label`               | Send                                                              |
| `subject-label`              | Subject                                                           |
